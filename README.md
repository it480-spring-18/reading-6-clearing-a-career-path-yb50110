Questions
---------

1. What's the main reason that people leave a career in testing, according to the article? (Bear in mind it was written in 2000!) **Answer:**
    
The article points that, at the time, software testing was deemed as a task for new developers and/or developers who were 
not good enough for other regular programming tasks. Testing, as the article states, "is often viewed as an undesirable 
and unchallenging career track." In other words, it was the mundane job for fresh developers who are beginning to work 
their ways up, or for those developers who failed at other roles such as software engineering, databases, system 
architectures, etc. 

1. What are the stages in their proposed career path for testers? **Answer:**

The article points out five steps (six including the certification step): apprenticeship, mastery, specialization, leadership, and reaching the top. 

The apprenticeship is the initial step to the career path where they work closely with a more experienced tester to help kick off their path. This is 
where you are level 1, the software tester. Next is the mastery step where you have accumulated enough knowledge and skills about testing to 
participate in actual test planning, test management, and test execution. You are now level 2, the software test engineer. At this point, 
you are still expected to be learning from your mentor. Then it is the specialization step where you become an expert, software test 
specialists, in one of the following areas: test tools and automation, test environment architecture, test equipment, architecture 
verification, operations readiness testing, and end-to-end testing. If you are able to become an expert in more than one of these 
areas or get to know one area extremely well, you can move up to the lead software test specialist position of the leadership 
step. Finally, in the reaching the top step, you can become the enterprise software tester who knows almost all core testing 
concepts and tools really well.
